And on its hallowed ground can be seen five stars of a pale blue. On your crest, that a clamorous sea shields with its roaring waves. Beyond a volcano, beyond a volcano its top bared there's a star, there's a star of radiant light.   Indian, virgin and beautiful you slept to the resounding chants of your sea, when, lying in your golden banks the bold navogator found you, and awe-struck at beholding your beauty under the perfect thrall of your charm, the blue hem of your splendid cape sanctified with his kiss of love.    Of a country where the sun rises, beyond the blue Atlantic, that man that had dreamed of you and set out to sea looking for you. When you raised your pale forehead, on the living anxiety of your longing, under the gentle dome of your sky a strange banner already floated.    It was useless that your beloved, the indian wrathfully prepared for the fight, because, his Lempirian blood wrapped around him he sunk into the depths of night. And of the epic deed, in his memory, only the legend has been kept, the place of its burial unknown to all and the stoic profile of a crag.    For three hundred your children heard the imperative call of the master, for three centuries your useless call got lost in the blue air. But one day, glory, your ear sensed that, powerful and distant, that far away, across the Atlantic, a lion roared in indignation.    It was France, the free, the heroic, that asleep in his centuries long dream, awakened, infuriated, to life at the virile call of Danton, it was France, that sent forth to death the head of the consecrated King, and that built, proud at its side the altar of the goddess Reason.    You too, o homeland! did rise of your deep, servile sleep and you, too, showed the world that laid in pieces the infamous link of your chain. And in your blessed soil, beyond the tall mane of the savage mountain, like a bird of black plumage, the short-lived colony was lost.    So as to keep this divine crest O homeland, we'll march into death. Our luck will be generous if we die while thinking of your love, defending your sacred flag. And many, Honduras, will be your dead wrapped up in your glorious folds, but all will fall with honor. https://lyricstranslate.com",honduras,present

How often did your own son agress My homeland, upon your breast, And you became because of your own sons Your own sons' funeral urn!

May God take my life, all my loved ones and possessions from me if He will, But may He not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world. Oh glorious God, the sole wish of my pain-stricken heart is that, No heathen's hand should ever touch the bosom of my sacred Temples. These adhans, whose shahadahs are the foundations of my religion, May their noble sound last loud and wide over my eternal homeland.For only then, shall my fatigued tombstone, if there is one, prostrate a thousand times in ecstasy, And tears of fiery blood shall flow out of my every wound, And my lifeless body shall gush out from the earth like an eternal spirit, Perhaps only then, shall I peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens.So ripple and wave like the bright dawning sky, oh thou glorious crescent, So that our every last drop of blood may finally be blessed and worthy! Neither you nor my race shall ever be extinguished! For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag; For independence is the absolute right of my God-worshiping nation!",turkey,present

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more! Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the war's desolation! Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust.""
